            The Angular Rules Engine is a Javascript/Typescript based rule engine that allows applications to contain simple or sophisticated
            business rule implementations as well as data validation.

          <h3>Why use this rule engine?</h3>
          <p>There is no such thing as a simple application - if it was so easy everyone would be developing applications, right?
            I cannot think of any application that didn't require some kind of validation or business rule processing.
          </p>
          <p>Rules and business logic is complicated enough. Use this rule engine to simplify your validation and business rule
            requirements. You can have consistent and maintainable business logic code. Stop playing in the mud and build
            some rules.
          </p>
          <h4>Rules Right Out of the Box - Ready to Go</h4>
          <p>This is what you get right out of the box...but wait, there's more! The framework contains (2) simple base classes
            that allow you to create simple to complex rules to satisfy the most demanding requirements.</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Provides a consistent way to implement business and validation rules and provide a consistent mechanism to retrieve
              the results.</li>
            <li>You can use the existing library of rules already implemented.
              <ul>
                <li>AreEqual</li>
                <li>AreNotEqual</li>
                <li>IsFalse</li>
                <li>IsTrue</li>
                <li>IsNullOrUndefined</li>
                <li>IsNotNullOrUndefined</li>
                <li>Max</li>
                <li>Min</li>
                <li>Range</li>
                <li>StringIsNotNullEmptyRange</li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li>You can create a reusable library of rules and use them in one or more applications.</li>
            <li>Combine default and one or more custom rules to create a
              <code>CompositeRule</code> - a rule that contains other rules (rule set).</li>
            <li>Each rule has a
              <code>Priority</code> property to execute rule sets in a specified sequence.</li>
            <li>Take advantage of Typescript classes to quickly create
              <code>simple</code> or
              <code>composite</code> (nested) rules using the API that is part of the framework.</li>
            <li>Use the
              <code>ValidationContext</code> to simply add, execute, and retrieve rule results.</li>
            <li>Code faster using Fluent API style syntax - be more productive.</li>
            <li>Using the
              <code>CompositeRule</code> base class, you can create a rule that contains other rules of either
              <code>simple</code> or
              <code>composite</code> types. The rule execution algorithm manages the complexity - now you can create rules and reuse rules to match
              your business logic.</li>
