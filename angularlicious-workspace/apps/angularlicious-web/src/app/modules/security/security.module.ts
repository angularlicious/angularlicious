 * The [SecurityModule] is a [feature service] module that does not contain any declarable items (i.e., components, directives, or pipes).
 * It is used to provide security domain features for the application. Other domain feature modules will use this module to implement
 * the functionality for security features (i.e., account creation, user login, etc.).
 *
 * Use the @NgModule attribute to configure the applications:
 * - declarations: None for [service feature module].
 * - imports: use to reference required modules for the feature.
 * - exports: items that are made public outside of the module
 *    - (i.e., only components, directives, or pipes). NEVER EXPORT SERVICES...USE providers array
 * - providers: services that are made public outside of the module.
 * - bootstrap (use for root module only): N/A
